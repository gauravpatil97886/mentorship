- So you‘ve heard about cloud computing, you know what it is, and you‘ve decided it could be a great tool for your business. Now, you want to dig a little deeper…

- Choosing the right cloud deployment model is essential to making sure your business gets the performance,
scalability, security, legal, and price structure it needs.

- There is no one-size-fits-all solution, and the different models exist to solve a particular set of problems. 
Choosing the best one will depend on all sorts of factors. In this guide, I’m going to go explain and discuss 4 best cloud deployment models, look at the benefits and limitations, and who should be using them. Hopefully, by the end, you‘ll have a great understanding of each cloud deployment model, and ready to take the next step on your cloud journey.

## DEPLOYMENT MODELS VS SERVICE MODELS:
-----

#### There are four main cloud deployment models:

------
##### public Cloud
##### Private Cloud
##### Community Cloud
##### Hybrid Cloud
-------
- These refer to the size, placement, and access level of a cloud environment. 
- They aren’t the same as the service models – Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
- If you aren’t 100% about each of these, you can take a look at this article for a description of each one.

### PUBLIC CLOUD:

-- The public cloud deployment model is the most widely understood out of the four. Chances are you use some sort of public cloud product already.
****Some of the most common examples of public cloud offerings are****:

****SaaS**** – Gmail, Microsoft 365, Dropbox, etc…
****PaaS**** – Google App Engine, Heroku…
****IaaS**** – Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services…

#### Public Cloud – Definition

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines public cloud as:

-  “The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public.
It may be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organization, or some combination of them
. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider.”

****Basically, public clouds

- Are open to the public
- Can be owned, managed, and operated by pretty much anyone
- Are located on the provider‘s premises
- To be open to everyone, public cloud deployment services are usually delivered over the internet.
- All you need is a web browser to access all sorts of software and tools. Anyone with the right hardware and resources can operate a public cloud.
- Just set up your servers and start renting out storage and computing power.

### Public Cloud – Pros

****The main advantages of using a public cloud are****:

- Low price (sometimes even free)
- Scalable
- Location independence
- It‘s easy!
- The big cloud providers like Amazon and Microsoft have huge pools of computing resources powering their public cloud services. This has to massive benefits for you. Firstly, it means you can take advantage of economy of scale. The cost of a large network is split between many people, so capital overheads and operational costs drop for individual users. Many cloud providers even let you have a certain amount of cloud access for free (e.g. Google drive).

Secondly, it means you have access to essentially unlimited computing resources instantaneously. Traditionally, if your website suddenly had a 20x spike in traffic, your servers would be overloaded and it would crash. Using something like Amazon Web Services, your website could scale from getting a few visitors per hour to millions and never go down. And, you would only pay for what you actually use.

The other key advantage of public cloud is its location independence and ease of use. You don‘t need to worry about where you are, the location of hardware, setup, network settings, infrastructure, or anything like that. Just plug in and pay for what you use as you use it. Businesses of all sizes are using the public cloud for web applications, document collaboration, webmail, and storage of non-sensitive data
